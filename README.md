# Milestone Project 2

For my milestone project, I have chosen to create a quiz game focused on Stargate SG1 TV Series. 

I plan to utilize the knowledge and experience gained from Milestone 1, which involved HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, to construct this project. In addition, I will build upon this foundation by incorporating JavaScript, thereby demonstrating my proficiency in this particular area of study.

The site comprises a single page that displays certain elements at specific junctures during gameplay, while concealing others. In retrospect, it might have been more prudent to divide the site into three separate pages, one for showcasing the buttons, another for displaying the gameHud, and a third for presenting the scoreboard.

## User Experience

### User Stories

As a first time user:

- I want to play a game where I can test my knowledge.
- I want the app to be visually appealing.
- I want to be able to navigate easily.
- I want to be able to understand how the game works.
- I want the game to be accesible on my mobile phone.

As a returning user:

- I want the questions to be varied.
- I want to be informed when I get an answer wrong, and what the right answer is.
- I want to keep track of my score on each game.
- I want to be able to jump straight in to playing.
- I want to be able to reset the questions.

As a frequent user:

- I want to be able to change the difficulty of the game.
- I want the game to be timed questions.
- I want to be able to view social media for other games/quizzes.

### Design

To create the quiz game, I plan to develop a single-page layout that will include instructions and a FAQ section, displayed via a modal created with the Bootstrap framework. Since the quiz will be centered around Stargate SG1, I believe it's fitting to incorporate a theme that reflects the main factions from the series, such as the Goa'uld and the Tauri.

1. **Font**

Keeping in the theme of Stargate, I have opted for a font that, in my opinion, bears resemblance to the primary title font used in the television series. I've made the choice of utilizing the [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?preview.text=stargate&preview.text_type=custom) Google font, with backup fonts of Georgia and serif. Font-weights are to include regular(400) & medium(500). I haven't picked a bold font as the weight of the font pushes the visual away from the original SG1 heading.

2. **Colours**

Representing both the Goa'uld (specifically the uniforms and ships) and the Tauri(uniforms and Stargate command), I have chosen the below colours.

3. **Imagery** 

Most of the imagery has been used, will have a sci-fi element to it. The Chappa'ai(Stargate) will be a prominent image on the quiz app/site.

Edit: At the project's outset, I made the conscious decision to avoid incorporating any images that might be subject to copyright infringement. Consequently, I opted to employ a background image from Unsplash and placed a solitary Stargate logo at the screen's apex.
